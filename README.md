# The Met Office Informatics Lab COVID-19 Response Platform

This platform is for COVID-19 researchers to explore relationships between COVID-19 and environmental factors. [For more information see our blog post](https://medium.com/informatics-lab/met-office-and-partners-offer-data-and-platform-for-covid-19-researchers-83848ac55f5f).

We are grateful to Microsoft Azure, The Environmental Futures and Big Data Impact Lab and the EU European Regional Development Fund for helping make this possible.

## Updates

Check here for regular updates on the platform, such as the provision of new datasets. 


## Quick Start

The Platform is an instance of Pangeo. It provides a JupyterLab environment to work in, which uses Jupyter notebooks as the standard coding environment.

* Learn more about [Pangeo](http://pangeo.io)
* Learn more about [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable)
* Learn more about [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html)

You can also learn more from the example notebooks provided in the `examples_and_docs` folder in your platform homespace.


## The data

Data provided on the platform can be found in the `datasets` folder in your platform homespace. This folder contains two further folders:

* `covid19-ancillary-data`: contains Met Office weather forecast data.
* `share`: this directory can be read and written by all researchers. It is intended for sharing data and research between one-another.

More detailed information about the weather data provided is available in the data README at `datasets/covid19-ancillary-data/README_data.md`.
