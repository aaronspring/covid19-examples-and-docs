    "# Creating a Custom Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 Response Platform comes with a default Python environment and a default R environment that you can use in notebooks to run code you have written. You may find that you need to use other packages not included in these default environments for some code that you are writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this is to create your own custom environment that includes the extra packages that you need to use. This notebook will take you through the steps needed to create your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment is a self-contained and usable install of a programming language, such as Python or R. The fact that it is self-contained means you can have multiple such installs on a single filesystem without them interfering with each other or causing each other to break. Environments bring the added advantage that they are very easy to switch between, so you can easily change environments based on the work you need to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "All environments on the COVID-19 Response Platform are provided as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments, including the default environments. Conda provides us with some very useful tools for creating, customising, activating and deactivating environments, and we'll make extensive use of `conda` throughout this guide."

All of the steps listed as code here can either be run in the Jupyter notebook, or copied into the JupyterLab terminal and run there.
